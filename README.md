## Installation
1. Clone the repo: git clone ( https://github.com/PalaniRahulDravid/Responsive-Dashboard.git )
2. Open index.html in your browser to view the dashboard UI.

### Future Updates (Backend)
- In the future, I plan to add a backend to handle dynamic data and user interactions. Once the backend is integrated, users will need to follow additional setup steps for server configuration.
- Stay tuned for updates on how to set up the backend environment and connect it with the frontend.

## Technologies Used
- *Frontend*: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
